## üìä Dataset & Data Model

The analysis is powered by a relational data model consisting of the following tables:

| Table | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Users** | Core information about gym members. |
| **Payments** | Detailed records of all revenue transactions. |
| **Expenses** | Records of all operational and business costs. |
| **Calendar** | A standard date table for robust time intelligence analysis. |

**Additional Slicers/Filters:** `Weight`, `Height`, `Age`, `Gender`, and `Activity Level` are available for granular filtering.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key DAX Measures

Advanced **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** were utilized to transform raw data into meaningful KPIs and complex fitness metrics.

| Measure | Formula Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Users_Count` | `DISTINCTCOUNT(Users[UserID])` |
| `Revenue` | `SUM(Payments[Amount])` |
| `Expenses` | `SUM(Expenses[Amount])` |
| `Profit` | `[Revenue] - [Expenses]` |
| `ProgressPercent` | `DIVIDE([Complete_Days],[Total_Days],0)*100` (Used for membership completion) |
| `BMI` | `ROUND(Weight / (HeightMeters * HeightMeters),1)` |
| `BMR` | `(10 * Weight) + (6.25 * Height) - (5 * Age) + Gender_Adjustment` |
| `TDEE` | `[BMR] * ActivityFactor` |

üëâ **Full List:** A complete list of all DAX measures is included in the provided file `Business Solution` (not in this README).
